* Getting all information from Eagle Library .lbr File

This script is written to see how many symbols, footprints and devices 
are present in an eagle library without the need to open it. I personaly 
am a PCB designer, and to open a library situated else where was a very 
slow task (slow pc) so I decided to automate the task.

** Step 1.
Parsing xml in eagle library for SYMBOLS and their pins.
